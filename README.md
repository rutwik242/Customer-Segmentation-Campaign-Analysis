# Customer-Segmentation-Campaign-Analysis
A fintech brand wanted to understand customer behavior and identify new opportunities for product launches. Their goal was to segment customers, uncover untapped markets, and validate marketing campaigns with data-driven evidence.
Segmented customers using demographics, transactions, and credit profiles, grouping them by age, income, credit limit, and purchase behavior.

Phase 1 – Target Market Identification:

Discovered that the 18–25 age group was an underutilized segment, showing strong spending in Electronics, Fashion, and Personal Care but limited credit card usage.

Phase 2 – A/B Testing for Launch Validation:

Designed and executed a controlled A/B Test with a targeted credit card offering.

Applied the Two-Sample Z-Test to measure statistical significance.

The test group achieved a 40% conversion rate, compared to the control group baseline.

Built interactive dashboards to communicate insights for strategic planning and marketing decisions.

Result:

Identified the 18–25 segment as a new high-potential market for credit card adoption.

Demonstrated a 40% uplift in conversions, translating into an estimated ₹8–10M in potential annual revenue uplift (based on average transaction values and conversion scaling).

Equipped leadership with data-backed dashboards, driving targeted marketing investments and more efficient customer acquisition.
